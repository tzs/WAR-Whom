v2.4
    The game function to get the list of all zones omits the Necropolis,
    which caused whom to overlook people in that zone. Whom now
    explicitly adds Necropolis to the zone list. 
========================================================================
v2.3
    Output goes to the "System General" channel now instead of the "Say"
    channel, to match 1.3.5's move of /who output to there.
========================================================================
v2.2
    "/whom sc" will now only count and show players in your tier.
    Before, it would count players of all ranks.

    It is now a bit faster on searches that are going to find a
    lot of players.

    "/whom trinity" will show members of the Gaiscioch guilds.
    This was actually in v2.0, but I didn't document it. This is
    probably only interesting to people playing Order on Badlands.
