v2.8.2
    No functional change. Just updating info to mark it is compatible
    with game version 1.4.1.
========================================================================
v2.8.1
    Fix a couple errors in the zone lists for the r1 and r4 options.
========================================================================
v2.8
    Tiers changed to match the new level ranges in 1.4:
        tier 1       1 - 15
        tier 2      16 - 26
        tier 3      27 - 39
        tier 4      40

    New options to list zones that are part of the RvR campaign:
        r1      Shows the tier 1 zones
        r2      Shows the tier 2 zones
        r3      Shows the tier 3 zones
        r4      Shows the tier 4 zones
    For example, r4 would show Reikland, Praag, and Chaos wastes
    from Empire/Chaos lands, Eataine, Dragonwake, and Caledor from
    the Elf lands, and Kadrin Valley, Thunder Mountain, and Black Crag
    from the Dwarf/Greenskin lands. Note the old fortress zones are not
    included.
========================================================================
v2.7
    Fix to work with game version 1.4 as is currently on the test
    server. This version also works with 1.3.6 on the live server.
========================================================================
v2.6
    Names for careers are now obtained from one of the game's data
    tables, instead of being hard coded. I think this *should* make
    it so /whom can recognize career archetypes correctly in
    non-English versions of the game. I have not been able to
    test this, however.
========================================================================
v2.5.1
    Will now handle the case of 30+ characters of the same level
    and class in the same zone, by searching by name if necessary
    to avoid overflow
========================================================================
v2.4
    The game function to get the list of all zones omits the Necropolis,
    which caused whom to overlook people in that zone. Whom now
    explicitly adds Necropolis to the zone list. 
========================================================================
v2.3
    Output goes to the "System General" channel now instead of the "Say"
    channel, to match 1.3.5's move of /who output to there.
========================================================================
v2.2
    "/whom sc" will now only count and show players in your tier.
    Before, it would count players of all ranks.

    It is now a bit faster on searches that are going to find a
    lot of players.

    "/whom trinity" will show members of the Gaiscioch guilds.
    This was actually in v2.0, but I didn't document it. This is
    probably only interesting to people playing Order on Badlands.
========================================================================
